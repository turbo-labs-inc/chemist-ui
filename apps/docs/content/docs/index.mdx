# Welcome to Chemist UI

Chemist UI is the interface lab for teams that need to ship across multiple design languages without duplicating work. We publish copy-paste ready compositions, typed component APIs, and theme contracts that hold Ant Design and shadcn/ui in parity today — with additional systems and frameworks queued.

## Mission

1. **Accelerate shipping.** Give product teams battle-tested UI compositions they can drop into production faster than starting from Figma each sprint.
2. **Respect the system.** Deliver pixel-perfect parity with the design kits product teams already rely on.
3. **Stay adaptable.** Make theme tokens and adapters first-class so any Chemist surface can swap design languages at runtime.

## Manifesto

- **Copy-paste first.** Docs examples are the real components. If it’s showcased here, the code is ready to paste and ship.
- **Parallel friendly.** Chemist’s Ranger plan keeps workstreams color-coded so branding, component, and docs tracks can move independently.
- **Open core.** Everything needed to ship a polished SaaS interface stays MIT. Paid plans keep the lab funded and unlock enterprise workflows.
- **Design system parity.** Tokens originate from shared chemistry. Each adapter presents the correct look and feel for its design language with zero drift.

Initial drops focus on React bindings. Vue and Svelte adapters land once the core catalog and theming APIs are proven in production.
