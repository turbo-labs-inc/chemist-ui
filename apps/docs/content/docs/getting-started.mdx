# Getting Started

Chemist UI ships as an open-core monorepo. Each package focuses on a single concern: core design tokens, framework bindings, and design-system adapters. Follow the steps below to load Chemist inside a React project.

## 1. Install workspace packages

We publish to npm and recommend pnpm for workspace-aware installs:

```bash
pnpm add @chemist-ui/core @chemist-ui/react antd
```

> Swap Ant Design for `@mui/material`, `@chakra-ui/react`, or any other supported runtime depending on the adapter you plan to ship.

Chemist exports every adapter and theme directly from `@chemist-ui/react`, so you can import the tokens you need without juggling extra workspace packages.

## 2. Wire the provider

Chemist exposes a provider that injects tokens and metadata into the component tree. Wrap your app layout to make them available everywhere.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { ChemistProvider, antDesignTheme } from '@chemist-ui/react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ChemistProvider designSystem="ant-design" theme={antDesignTheme}>
      {children}
    </ChemistProvider>
  );
}
```

> Themes expose runtime-safe metadata — including brand colors, typography scales, and radius tokens — so your own components can stay in sync with Chemist primitives.

## 3. Copy a component

Paste any example from the docs into your project. Each snippet maps to the published package entry points.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { Button } from '@chemist-ui/react/button';

export default function DashboardCTA() {
  return <Button variant="primary">Launch sequence</Button>;
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Component timeline">
Black Ranger is actively finalizing the launch-day catalog (Button, Card, Input, Navigation primitives). Preview builds go up weekly — follow the {" "}
<a href="/docs/roadmap">roadmap</a> for drops.
</Callout>

## 4. Switch design systems

Swap adapters without altering application logic. The provider rehydrates tokens instantly.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { ChemistProvider, shadcnTheme } from '@chemist-ui/react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ChemistProvider designSystem="shadcn" theme={shadcnTheme}>
      {children}
    </ChemistProvider>
  );
}
```
